First Day
---------
- Notes from the screencast: http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/
- Linus Torvalds
- Can do everything offline - Branching, Merging, Reverting, Committing
- Distributed - push/pull/from/to/any repo
- Create branches all the time - much easier
- much cleaner - no .svn files throughout your directory
- whitespace, aliases

Second Day
----------

- Content - Not Files
